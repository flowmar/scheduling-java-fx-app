***Directions: To run the program, you must make sure that a mySQL server is running on your machine. Open the
project in IntelliJ, and click on the hammer icon to build the project.
You must have certain VM Options set in order to properly run the JavaFX application:
 --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media,javafx.base,javafx.graphics --add-exports javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.sg.prism=ALL-UNNAMED
Click the play button to run it.

***Additional Report Information: The additional report I created was a User report that allows the user to select from
a list of Users. The appointments that the selected User has entered into the system are displayed along with the total
number of appointments.
